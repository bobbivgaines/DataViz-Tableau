# Data Visualization with Tableau
## Overview
This project is focused on flight cancellations across multiple airlines. Tableau is used to help visualize the data using a combination of charts along with an interactive dashboard.

### Insight 1

This bar chart compares the amount of flight cancellations for each airline. It reveals Southwest Airlines having the most flight cancellations with the total being 818. Hawaiian Airlines, with only 8 cancellations, had the lowest amount. The difference in height of the bars in the bar chart helps to clearly display the numerical order from least to greatest of flight cancellations.
 
### Insight 2

A line graph is used to determine which months have the most flight cancellations per airline. Month 2 (February) shows American Eagle Airlines having the most cancellations with a total of 203. I chose a line graph for this insight to display the trend in the number of cancellations from month to month. The colors were chosen to determine which line belongs to a specific airline making it easier for viewers to differentiate between them.
